The Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem used for educational and benchmarking purposes. The goal of this task is to categorize iris flowers into one of three species based on measurements of their sepals and petals.


K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple and intuitive algorithm that classifies data points based on the class of the majority of their nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful algorithm that finds a hyperplane that best separates the different classes in the feature space.

Decision Trees: A tree-based algorithm that recursively splits the data based on features to create a decision tree for classification.

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

Logistic Regression: A linear regression-based algorithm used for binary classification (though it can be extended to multiclass problems).

Neural Networks: Deep learning models that can be used for complex classification tasks like Iris flower classification.
